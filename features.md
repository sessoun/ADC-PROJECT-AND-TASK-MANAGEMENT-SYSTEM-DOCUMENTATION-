## Authentication

### Overview
The authentication feature allows users to securely sign up, log in, log out, and reset their passwords. It ensures that only authorized users can access protected pages such as projects, tasks, comments, and notifications.

### User Stories
- As a new user, I want to sign up so that I can be added to a project then be assigned a task.  
- As a returning user, I want to log in so that I can access projects I have been added to and the tasks available for me.  
- As a user, I want to reset my password so that I can recover access if I forget it.  
- As an admin, I want to manage user accounts so that I can control who has access to the system.  

### User Flow
1. The user opens the application and is directed to the login page.
2. If the user does not have an account, they click "Sign Up" to register.
3. The system verifies the user's details and creates a new account.
4. Upon successful login, the user is redirected to the dashboard.
5. If the user forgets their password, they click "Forgot Password".
6. The system sends a password reset link to the user's registered email.
7. The user opens the link, enters a new password, and confirms it.
8. When the user clicks "Logout", their session is ended, and they are redirected to the login page.
